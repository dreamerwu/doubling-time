Suppose the cell growth rate is r, the initial cell mass is P(0), P(t) means the cell mass at time t.

So P(t)=P(0) * (1+r)^t # P(t) as an expotential function of time t.

log(P(t)) = log(P(0) * (1+r)^t)

log(P(t)) = log(P(0)) + log(1+r) * t # log(P(t)) as an linear function of time t.

Doubling time means how long do cells double its mass.

So when P(t)=2 * P(0), what is t?

P(t)=2 * P(0)=P(0) * (1+r)^t

2=(1+r)^t

log(2)=log((1+r)^t)

log(2)=t * log(1+r)

So doubling time (t)=log(2)/log(1+r)
